# 16-Point FFT ASIC Design Flow

## Introduction

This repository contains the complete design and implementation of a 16-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) ASIC. The FFT is a fundamental algorithm in digital signal processing that efficiently computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence, reducing the computational complexity from O(N²) to O(N log N).

This implementation focuses on optimizing for power efficiency and area constraints while maintaining high throughput for real-time applications. The design employs a radix-2 decimation-in-time (DIT) architecture and has been verified through extensive simulation and physical implementation.

## Problem Statement

Modern signal processing applications demand efficient hardware implementations of FFT algorithms that can deliver:

1. High computational throughput for real-time processing
2. Low power consumption for battery-powered or energy-constrained devices
3. Minimal silicon area to reduce manufacturing costs
4. Sufficient numerical precision for the target applications

This project addresses these challenges by implementing a 16-point FFT processor specifically designed for ASIC implementation, with careful consideration of architectural trade-offs to optimize power, performance, and area (PPA) metrics.
